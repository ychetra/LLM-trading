    #       train = first train_frac, val = next val_frac, test = remaining.
    #       Used by run_pipeline.py / view_results.py / final_holdout_eval.py.
    #
    #   (b) Walk-forward (default for RL) → data_loader.make_walk_forward_folds()
    #       The last test_frac of bars is sealed as the final holdout; the
    #       remaining "development" region is cut into (n_folds + 1) equal blocks
    #       whose validation windows roll forward in time.  See train_ppo.train_walk_forward().
    #
    # test_frac is kept equal to (1 - train_frac - val_frac) so the sealed test
    # is byte-for-byte identical in both modes — whichever one produced the model,
    # final_holdout_eval.py evaluates it on the same untouched holdout.
    #
    # Long Bid dataset (May 2003 – May 2026, ~23 years of H1 ≈ 138 K bars):
    #   • single split → ~16 yr train / ~3.5 yr val / ~3.5 yr test

    # ── Sliding-window walk-forward (realistic retrain simulation) ───────────
    # train_ppo.train_sliding_walk_forward(): each fold trains on
    # `sliding_train_years`, selects its checkpoint on the next
    # `sliding_val_months`, then is judged TRUE out-of-sample on the following
    # `sliding_test_months`. The whole window then slides forward by
    # `sliding_step_months` and repeats — simulating "retrain every step_months,
    # then trade the next test_months live." Stitching every fold's test window
    # gives one continuous out-of-sample equity track record.
    #
    # Because every train window is the SAME calendar length, equal timesteps per
    # fold already means equal passes over the data (no per-fold scaling needed).
    #
    # Note on cost: with a 6-month step over ~23 years you get ~34 folds, i.e.
